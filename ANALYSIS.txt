The recursive formula I used calculates the optimal cost matrix along the diagonal of the matrix inputed. It compares the cost of traveling from start to finish with traveling through one post. One post is used because all the paths can be simplified down to using one post if the optimal cost matrix is calculated along the diagonals.
