# VirtualCanoeTrip

Name: Aaron Saijan, Project: Programming assignment 3, Class: CS203 

Analysis
--------

The recursive formula I used calculates the optimal cost matrix along the diagonal of the matrix inputed. It compares the cost of traveling from start to finish with traveling through one post. One post is used because all the paths can be simplified down to using one post if the optimal cost matrix is calculated along the diagonals.





How to compile and run together
------------------------------

- launch VirtualCanoeTrip.java using and IDE and compile and run.

or 

Compile
------
in directory of VirtualCanoeTrip.java file, run the following command: javac VirtualCanoeTrip.java


Run
------
In the directory, run the command: java VirtualCanoeTrip "input.txt" 

input file should also be in the same directory

*Commands may be different for Mac users*
